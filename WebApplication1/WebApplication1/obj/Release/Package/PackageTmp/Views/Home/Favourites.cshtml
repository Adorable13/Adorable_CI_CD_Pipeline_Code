                    "Avengers Infinity Saga Variant" is not an official term in Marvel
                    Studios canon, but it could be referring to alternate storylines or
                    "what if" scenarios within the 23 interconnected MCU films. Disney+'s
                    "What If...?" explored alternate realities and timelines based on key
                    moments in the MCU, while "Loki" used the term "Variant" to refer to
                    alternate versions of characters and timelines. However, a definitive
                    answer is difficult to provide without more specific context or information.
